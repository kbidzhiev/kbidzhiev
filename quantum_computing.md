# Quantum computing

Quantum computing is based on rules of atomic physics which are mathematically framed in *Quantum mechanics*

The main storyline revolves around qubits, which I will now discuss.

## Qubits
Classical information can be encoded in a sequence of *0* and *1*.
By information one can uderstand most of the desktop or laptop related *digital* activities. Music that we can hear from loudspeakers of our mobile phones is encodes as a sequence `...010100100010...`, videos and likes that we see on a screen of our computer when surfing social networks and internet are encoded in a similar streams of zeros and ones.
Computers helps to automatise some routine tasks, simplifies shopping, and even helps to maintain contact with friends and family who might be far away from you. Generally speaking, computers help us to solve problems.

Are there problems that computers can not solve ?
Is there something, that can not be presented in a digital language or simply can not be stored in our computers ? Definitely yes.
