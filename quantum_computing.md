# Quantum computing

Quantum computing is based on rules of atomic physics which are mathematically framed in *Quantum mechanics*

The main storyline revolves around qubits, which I will now discuss.

## Qubits

Classical information can be encoded in a sequence of *0* and *1*.
By information, one can understand most of the desktop or laptop-related *digital* activities. Music that we can hear from the loudspeakers of our mobile phones is encoded as a sequence `...010100100010...`, and videos and likes that we see on the screen of our computer when surfing social networks and the internet are encoded in similar streams of zeros and ones. Computers help to automate some routine tasks, simplify shopping, and even help to maintain contact with friends and family who might be far away from you. Generally speaking, computers help us to solve problems.

What is a qubit and how it is different from classical bites 0 and 1?
Classical bits represent information about state of something. For instance, does water flaw in a pipe? If yes one writes 1 else no i.e. 0. Do you see a cat: 1 or 0.
In a quantum case situation is different. Microworld of atomic interactions has probabilistic behaviour. 




Are there problems that computers cannot solve? Is there something that cannot be presented in a digital language or simply cannot be stored in our computers? Definitely, yes.
