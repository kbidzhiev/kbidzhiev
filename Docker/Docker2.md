# Your first container [BusyBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox) - "The Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux"

BusyBox is designed to emulate Unix-like terminal input and output interactions. This page will demonstrate how to run a basic container and review its current and previous statuses.

First, to begin working, pull the container image onto your system.
```bash
sudo docker pull busybox
```

the output is
```plaintext
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/busybox
ec562eabd705: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:9ae97d36d26566ff84e8893c64a6dc4fe8ca6d1144bf5b87b2b85a32def253c7
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
docker.io/library/busybox:latest
```

To see what is already installed on your computer, run 
```bash
sudo docker images
```
output should be similar to
```plaintext
REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
ubuntu        latest    17c0145030df   9 days ago      76.2MB
busybox       latest    65ad0d468eb1   12 months ago   4.26MB
hello-world   latest    d2c94e258dcb   13 months ago   13.3kB
```

Running the container with a command similar to 'hello-world' as shown below:
```bash
sudo docker run busybox
```
produces no output. The effect of the above command is akin to pressing 'enter' after an empty command in a real Unix terminal. To see a response, you should run:
```bash
sudo docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"
```

This command explicitly instructs the BusyBox container to execute the `echo` command and output "hello from busybox".
Also, one can get an interactive terminal with `-it` command
```bash
sudo docker run -it busybox sh
```


# Cleaning up
The command `docker run` leaves behind large files after each execution. If you do not intend to use them, please ensure they are cleaned up.

To see what remains after running containers, use the following command:
```bash
sudo docker ps -a
#sudo docker ps #lists active containers
```
This command lists all containers, including those that are not currently active. The `-a` option shows all containers, both running and stopped, providing a complete overview of the container instances on your system.

The output reads
```

```

The first column `CONTAINER ID` allows you to chose and delete several containers at once
```bash
sudo docker rm b74e885e4a92 95078a9c5748
```
