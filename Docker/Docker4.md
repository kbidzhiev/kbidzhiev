# Creating your own container

As we briefly mentioned before, image is used to build a container. We have already seen an example of this on DockerHub with the image ["python 3.9-bookworm"](https://github.com/docker-library/python/blob/1b7a1106674a21e699b155cbd53bf39387284cca/3.9/bookworm/Dockerfile) and its Dockerfile instructions.

To build our own image for the container, we are going to write Dockerfile

Dockerfile is a set of instructions with it's syntaxis. Basically I'm going to repeat what we did with numpy installation, but in a Dockerfile.


```Dockerfile
